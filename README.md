During my internship at Codsoft, I developed three distinct Java applications, each serving a unique purpose:

Number Guessing Game:
This application challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.
The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the user narrow down the possibilities.
It incorporates features like setting the maximum number of attempts and tracking the number of guesses made.

Student Grade Calculator:
This tool allows students to input their marks for various subjects.
The application then calculates the average score and assigns a corresponding grade based on predefined criteria.

Currency Converter:
This utility helps users convert amounts between different currencies.
It uses up-to-date exchange rates to ensure accurate conversions.
The application allows for conversions between multiple currencies and can handle both large and small amounts, making it practical for a variety of financial tasks.
These projects have strengthened my skills in Java programming, user interface design, and application logic implementation.
